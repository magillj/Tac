# Tac
A Tic Tac Toe Chrome extension. 

I made this mostly just because I thought it'd be a fun, easy way to learn how to create chrome extensions. 

I'll publish this to the Chrome store as soon as I feel it's a complete product ready to ship.

TODO List:
 - Configurable AI randomness to simulate human error
 - Gamestate saving to protect against accidental clicks outside the popup
 - Multiplayer?


If you'd like to try it out for yourself, see the "Load the extension" part of the guide below. It literally takes 10 seconds.
