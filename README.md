# Tac
A Tic Tac Toe Chrome extension. 

I made this mostly just because I thought it'd be a fun, easy way to learn how to create chrome extensions. 

I'll probably puplish this on the chrome store once it's fully functional with several difficulty levels, better grapics,
and functional saving mechanisms so when the user clicks out of an active game (perhaps accidentally) it'll be save so when
they open the extension popup again their game will still be there.

TODO List:
 - Create a difficult AI
 - Create an AI that never loses
 - User option saving
 - Make everything look nicer (including a relevant icon)
 - Gamestate saving to protect against accidental clicks outside the popup


If you'd like to try it out for yourself, see the "Load the extension" part of the guide below. It literally takes 10 seconds.
